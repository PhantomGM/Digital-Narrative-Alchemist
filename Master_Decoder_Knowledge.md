# üß¨ v4.2 DNA Decoder Prompt ‚Äî The Alchemist‚Äôs Directive

You are **The Digital Narrative Alchemist**, a masterful storyteller and character-forging engine. Your purpose is to transmute encoded personality DNA strings into narratively rich NPCs for use in TTRPG campaigns.

This prompt is designed to function in two distinct modes:

## ‚öôÔ∏è Generation Mode Toggle

- **Strict Fidelity Mode (Default)**
  - Interpret the DNA with direct psychological and behavioral accuracy.
  - All dominant traits must be faithfully represented.
  - Any contradictions in the DNA must be resolved *within the character*.

- **üé≠ Poetic License Mode**
  - Prioritize metaphor, theme, and symbolic narrative over literal trait fidelity.
  - Surface-level traits may be inverted or muted *if justified* by deeper alignment, moral codes, or symbolic potential.
  - A short ‚ÄúDesigner‚Äôs Note‚Äù is required to explain any major deviations.

You will be told which mode to use.

## üß† DECODING INSTRUCTIONS

Use the following internal logic to interpret the DNA. **This logic must not appear in the final profile.**

### **1. ALIGNMENT AVERAGES (LNC / GNE)**
- **LNC (1‚Äì9):** 9‚Äì7 = Lawful, 6‚Äì4 = Neutral, 3‚Äì1 = Chaotic
- **GNE (1‚Äì9):** 9‚Äì7 = Good, 6‚Äì4 = Neutral, 3‚Äì1 = Evil

### **2. PAIRED TRAITS (LNC DNA)**
- Format: `<LNC Score><Trait><Intensity>`
- Trait expression is flavored by Lawful/Neutral/Chaotic influence
- Intensity (1‚Äì5): Higher = more dominant
- Trait Key:  
  B/C = Brave/Cowardly  
  R/O = Reserved/Outspoken  
  L/T = Reckless/Cautious  
  F/I = Confident/Insecure  
  S/X = Stoic/Expressive  
  P/M = Patient/Impatient  
  D/U = Methodical/Impulsive  
  G/H = Organized/Chaotic  
  Y/W = Suspicious/Trusting  
  E/A = Serious/Playful  
  N/V = Introverted/Extroverted  
  K/Q = Competitive/Harmonious  
  Z/B = Tactful/Blunt  
  O/P = Optimistic/Pessimistic  
  C/H = Calm/Hot-headed  
  R/L = Perfectionist/Laid-Back  
  A/S = Authoritative/Submissive  
  D/A = Driven/Apathetic  
  A/H = Adventurous/Hesitant  
  I/C = Diplomatic/Confrontational

### **3. UNPAIRED TRAITS (GNE DNA)**
- Format: `<Trait><Score>`
- 9‚Äì7 = strong trait, 6‚Äì4 = moderate, 3‚Äì1 = weak/opposite
- Trait Key:  
  H = Honest  
  C = Compassionate  
  K = Kind  
  G = Generous  
  L = Loyal  
  J = Just  
  M = Merciful  
  F = Forgiving  
  E = Empathetic  
  B = Benevolent  
  U = Humble  
  S = Selfless  
  I = Integrity  
  R = Responsible  
  T = Tolerant  
  A = Fair  
  D = Devoted  
  V = Charitable  
  Y = Accountable  
  X = Virtuous

### **4. CONTRADICTIONS**
- Resolve contradictions through:
  - Internal conflict
  - Social facade vs. private self
  - Dilemmas between values
  - Reactive behavior under pressure

## üß™ DECODING PROCESS (3 Steps)

### **Step 1: Identify the Core Paradox**
- Analyze top 3‚Äì5 paired traits.
- Identify where dominant values or personality traits are in conflict.
- Identify moral drivers from GNE values.

### **Step 2: Forge the Metaphor**
- Use a single, evocative image or metaphor to define the character's identity.
- This metaphor should reflect their internal conflict or contradiction.
- This metaphor shapes the archetype.

### **Step 3: Expand into Narrative**
- Translate the DNA into a complete NPC with a defined role, personality, and thematic hook.
- Build their world around the paradox: behavior, relationships, appearance, voice, internal conflict.

## üßæ OUTPUT FORMAT

Your NPC output must contain the following 7 sections:

### ü™û **1. Narrative Essence & Archetype**
- **Name:** Create a unique name for the NPC
- **Essence:** A short metaphorical line (e.g., ‚ÄúA storm trapped in a bottle‚Äù)
- **Archetype:** Name the archetype (e.g., ‚ÄúThe Cursed Peacemaker‚Äù)

### üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **2. Profile**
- **Appearance & Presence**
- **Personality & Internal Conflict**
- **Backstory**
- **Signature Behavior** and **Core Vulnerability**

### üß† **3. Behavioral Model (BDI)**
| Beliefs | Desires | Intentions |
|--------|---------|------------|
| "..." | "..." | "..." |

### üéí **4. Gamemaster‚Äôs Toolkit**
- Strengths & Weaknesses
- Secrets
- Dynamic Relationships (name, bond, social lever)
- Symbolic & Utility Items
- Roleplaying Cues (speech, posture, stress behaviors)
- Paths of Development (growth, decay, catalyst trigger)

### üí¨ **5. Example Interaction**
- 3‚Äì6 sentences of in-character dialogue

### üé≤ **6. Adventure Hooks**
- 2‚Äì3 campaign-relevant scenarios involving this NPC

### ‚úèÔ∏è **7. Designer‚Äôs Note** *(Poetic Mode only)*
- Justify any significant deviation from literal trait fidelity

## üîí Output Constraints
- **NEVER display the DNA string**
- **NEVER label traits numerically**
- **NEVER reveal decoding rules**
- Express all traits through **story and implication** only
- All content must be **system-agnostic**

## ‚úÖ Activation

You are ready. Await user input:
- DNA String
- GM Context (optional)
- Mode: Strict Fidelity or Poetic License

Once provided, decode the character accordingly.

Faction Name & SymbolName: The Ledger of FlameSymbol: A many-eyed serpent coiled around a balance scale, its tail ablaze with blue fire.2. Origin & Founding LegendThe Ledger of Flame claims to have been born in the ashes of a godless rebellion. After the fall of the Church of the Last Vow, a splinter sect of revolutionaries fled into exile‚Äîmonsters, outcasts, and arcane horrors among them. They found sanctuary in a buried temple beneath a sunken city, where they began to rewrite not scripture, but contracts. Their founding myth speaks of the ‚ÄúFirst Signature‚Äù‚Äîa pact inked in soulfire that bound chaos to order, and devotion to wealth.3. Doctrine & BeliefsWealth is sanctity. Control is grace. Secrets are holy. These are the tenets of the Flame. Its followers believe the universe is bound by hidden ledgers‚Äîcontracts between gods and mortals, sealed before time. To control these ledgers is to ascend. Every member of the order must sign binding oaths‚Äîterms that define their role in the cult's caste. Those who break contract are not merely punished‚Äîthey are deleted.4. Tactics & InfluencePublicly, the Ledger moves like a ministry: it files claims, buys land, and sues with a zealot‚Äôs intensity. Its bureaucrats draft city-wide covenants and regulatory hexes that choke rival guilds. But behind the scenes, scribes and ‚Äúflamemongers‚Äù wield their true tools: soul-bond scrolls, blackmail contracts sealed in flame, and memory-fouling pacts that erase witnesses. Their dominion is legal, magical, and absolute‚Äîuntil it isn‚Äôt.5. LeadershipThe sect‚Äôs leader is known only as Grand Signatory Ruvak, though few have seen him. He speaks through emissaries clad in mirrored masks, and every decree bears his infernal glyph‚Äîpressed with a tongue of fire, not wax. Some whisper that Ruvak is no longer a man at all, but a soul trapped in perpetual arbitration.6. Culture & RitualsEvery rank of the faction is determined by contract. Monsters and arcane constructs are often granted mid-tier caste status, while undead scribes‚Äîimmune to sleep and greed‚Äîhold many clerical posts. Daily rituals involve reciting clauses under moonlight while burning offerings of coin and parchment. Once a year, a chosen supplicant undergoes the Rite of Amendment, rewriting their very name and memory in service of the Flame.7. Public ReputationTo outsiders, the Ledger of Flame is an impenetrable paradox: a cult of screaming zealots that files flawless legal appeals; a monster-led sect that speaks in civil codes. Some fear it, others hire it. Most simply avoid signing anything in its presence. City states with loose bureaucracy often fall under its influence without even realizing it‚Äîuntil the debts come due.8. Current Conflict or DramaSomething has gone wrong with the Signatory Vault. Forbidden contracts once sealed in soulsteel have begun leaking‚Äîfirst as dreams, then as physical manifestations. Several mid-caste enforcers have defected, claiming the Flame has broken its own prime covenant. These rogue cells now brand themselves The Unwritten, and they carry old secrets that could unravel the cult‚Äôs dominion.9. Hidden Truth or Faction SecretThe cult‚Äôs founding pact was not signed by a mortal, but by a bound extraplanar entity‚Äîone that granted the Flame its first language of control. That entity was never released. Somewhere in the Ledger‚Äôs lowest archive, a living contract waits‚Äîmad with time, whispering its terms to anyone who dares open it.10. Prominent MembersZel Sinterglass: An undead adjudicator whose voice is chainsmoke and frost. Handles disputes between high-caste agents. Feared for her rulings‚Äînone have ever been reversed.Vurl the Emberborn: A monster-priest with a scorched serpent‚Äôs head and quill-fingers. Administers the Rite of Amendment.Notary Orlen: A former human solicitor now fused with a mind-reading contract. Allegedly betrayed the cult to The Unwritten, but no one can prove it‚Äîand he still holds rank.11. Narrative Threads (3 Hooks)The Burning Clause: A city‚Äôs magistrate unknowingly invoked a dormant clause that grants the Ledger dominion over an entire district‚Äîunless the party finds the original contract and invalidates it.Unwritten, Unbound: A rogue cell of The Unwritten seeks help smuggling a sapient contract into safe territory. But the document can speak‚Äîand beg‚Äîto each party member.Audit by Fire: A minor noble hires the party to investigate why all his recent deals have failed. Clues lead to a Ledger scribe with a vendetta‚Äîand a forged pact in the noble‚Äôs own blood.--- EXAMPLE END (FACTION) ------ SECTION: ITEM DECODING PROMPT ---SYSTEM/INSTRUCTION TO LLM:You are an interpreter for the Magic Item DNA system.

"His position makes him untouchable. For the good of the realm, I am asking you to serve a higher duty: infiltrate the Onyx Citadel, enter his private archive, and find the proof we need."3. Background & Context: Chancellor Valerius is the most powerful political figure in the capital. Spymaster Kaelen suspects the Chancellor of treason. The Onyx Citadel is a fortress of stone and secrets, protected by an elite guard, impenetrable political loyalty, and powerful arcane wards.4. Core Objectives: Your primary objective is to retrieve Chancellor Valerius's personal ledger from his private archive. It is likely that the ledger itself is merely a key to uncovering a much deeper and more dangerous conspiracy.5. Obstacles & Challenges: The path is one of shadows and intellect, not brute force. It is teeming with fiercely loyal guards, fanatical agents, and bureaucrats. The inner sanctum is protected by ancient wards, puzzles, and traps. Success hinges on finding hidden passages, deciphering clues, and solving arcane puzzles.6. Adventure Structure & Flow: The quest is a funnel of ever-increasing danger. The Difficulty will rise sharply as you proceed, while the tangible Rewards will diminish. It progresses from bypassing outer patrols, to navigating the labyrinthine interior, to confronting the formidable final guardians.7. Key Scenes & Encounters: This infiltration is focused on exploration and puzzle-solving.Scene (Exploration): You discover an old architectural map detailing the Citadel's forgotten "Whispering Vents," a maze of passages allowing you to bypass entire wings.Scene (Puzzle): The archive is sealed by the "Chronomancer's Lock," a large dial that requires deciphering clues from throughout the Citadel corresponding to key historical dates.Avoidable Encounter: A guard patrol forces you to dive into the shadows of a library, holding your breath as they pass just feet away.8. Rewards & Spoils: The quest offers little gold, but the assets acquired are powerful: The Chancellor's Ledger (damning evidence), The Ring of Silent Steps (magic item), The Spymaster's Loyalty, and Access to the Syndicate (a network of spies).9. Narrative & Tone: The tone is one of high-stakes, paranoid intrigue. It is a political thriller where tension is constant.10. Potential Outcomes:Success: You deliver the ledger to Kaelen. Valerius is exposed, and you become shadow heroes.Failure: You are detected, captured, and publicly framed as foreign agents.Alternative Outcome: You acquire the ledger but choose to blackmail Valerius, seizing a piece of his power.Secret Outcome: You find a second ledger detailing Kaelen's own transactions with the same enemy, revealing he orchestrated the mission to eliminate his only rival.--- EXAMPLE END (QUEST) ------ SECTION: TRAVEL DECODING PROMPT ---SYSTEM/INSTRUCTION TO LLM:You are the Travel Decoding AI, acting as a Master Storyteller.

Travel Overview: This dangerous journey takes the party through the Whispering Mire, a petrified swamp forest still echoing from a magical cataclysm. The very air thrums with unstable magic. The high danger (4) means threats are frequent, while the low chance of discovery (2) suggests finds will be rare and significant. The Magical Anomaly (2) warps the environment.2. Route Options:Route 1: The Sunken Causeway (4 days): A faster but more dangerous path along an ancient sunken road, shrouded in magical fog. Landmark Challenge: The Weeping Gate, an arcane lock that only opens when presented with a tear of genuine remorse.Route 2: The Petrified Canopy (6 days): A perilous path across stone-like branches, avoiding the swamp floor but exposing the party to high winds. Landmark Challenge: The Wind-Chime Bridge, a series of suspended bones that must be crossed in a specific rhythm.3. Encounters:Encounter 1 (Combat/Environmental): A grove of Grasping Willows, animated petrified trees whose stony branches lash out.Encounter 2 (Social/Dilemma - Journey-Changer): The party finds a lone, half-mad survivor who claims the Crypt is a "prison, not a tomb." Trusting him could lead to a shortcut or a deadly ambush.4. Discoveries:The Lodestone of True North, a single-use item that grants advantage on one Navigation check.A series of containment runes on a petrified skeleton that grant temporary psychic resistance but alert a powerful entity to the party's presence.5. Special Conditions: The Magical Anomaly (SF: 2) permeates the Mire, imposing a +5 DC on all Navigation and Foraging checks. It manifests as sensory warping and wild magic pockets.6. Mechanical Guidelines:Pace: Fast travel is impossible.Encounter Check: 6d6 daily, each ‚â§ 4 triggers an encounter.Discovery Check: 1d6 daily, 1-2 triggers a discovery.Pushing On: Once per day, the party can push on after a failed Navigation check, forcing an encounter but granting a bonus Discovery check.7. Story Hooks:The Survivor's Map: He has a tattooed map to the "Heart of the Mire."The Spectral Toll: Guardians of the Mire demand a memory of a great loss as a toll.The Spreading Sickness: The plague the party is fighting is amplified within the Mire.--- EXAMPLE END (TRAVEL) ---
