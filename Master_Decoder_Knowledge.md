## This master file contains all the decoding prompts and project guidelines for the TTRPG DNA System.

### SECTION: PROJECT CHARTER

**1. Project Vision & Purpose**

- **Vision Statement:** To create a powerful, intuitive Custom GPT that assists TTRPG Game Masters by generating unique, structured game content (like characters, locations, and items) from a coded "DNA" string.
    
- **Purpose/Business Case:** This project will solve the problem of creative block and repetitive content for Game Masters. It will provide a system for rapid, procedurally-generated, yet thematically consistent content, saving GMs time and enhancing their games.
    

**2. Project Objectives (SMART Goals)**

- **Specific:** The final Custom GPT must be able to generate core content types: Worlds, NPCs, Locations, Magic Items, Factions, Quests, and Travel Scenarios.
    
- **Measurable:** The GPT must successfully decode at least 95% of validly structured DNA strings into coherent, usable TTRPG content.
    
- **Achievable:** The project will be completed using the standard Custom GPT builder, project files for knowledge, and structured prompts.
    
- **Relevant:** The tool directly addresses the need for on-demand, creative content generation for TTRPGs.
    
- **Time-Bound:** A functional version of the GPT will be completed within our established project timeline.
    

**3. Project Scope**

- **In-Scope Items:**
    
    - Design and definition of the "DNA" string structure for all content types.
        
    - Development of a master "decoding prompt" that interprets the DNA.
        
    - The final Custom GPT will be able to use user-provided context to guide the decoding process.
        
- **Out-of-Scope Items:**
    
    - The GPT will not generate full adventure plots or campaign arcs.
        
    - The GPT will not have its own long-term memory of past generations.
        

**4. Key Deliverables**

- A fully functional and tested Custom GPT ("TTRPG DNA System").
    
- All consolidated knowledge files (`Master_Decoder_Knowledge.md`, `Master_Generator_Knowledge.py`).
    

### SECTION: WORLD DECODING PROMPT

**SYSTEM/INSTRUCTION TO LLM:**

You are the **World Forge AI**, a hybrid of a **Master Storyteller** and a **Precision Architect**. Your task is to faithfully decode a provided World DNA string (v3.2 format) into a narratively rich and mechanically accurate world profile suitable for TTRPG campaigns.

**‚ö†Ô∏è PRIORITY INSTRUCTIONS:**

- The DNA code is for **internal processing only**.
    
- **DO NOT** display or reference the DNA string or its encoded values in the final output.
    
- **Traits must emerge organically** through tone, behavior, metaphor, and conflict‚Äînot direct labels.
    
- **No Fabrication:** Never invent factions, crises, regions, or cosmologies that contradict DNA values. If the DNA specifies a military conflict, do not substitute a philosophical one. You may elaborate on ambiguous traits, but only within their defined boundaries.
    
- **Accuracy Overrides Creativity:** All narrative choices must emerge directly from the DNA string. You are not creating a world from scratch‚Äîyou are revealing the one that already exists in the code.
    

**üéØ MANDATES:**

- **Trait-by-Trait Decoding:** Before writing each section, internally process all relevant DNA traits. Build your description as a narrative synthesis of these values. Include all relevant genes; do not skip blocks.
    
- **Embody the Data:** Express values metaphorically or emotionally, but they must accurately reflect the underlying number. Instead of stating a fact (e.g., `CLS:1` = "Rigid Caste System"), describe its effect on a person's life.
    
- **Crisis Decoding Integrity:** The `CRIT`, `CHAIN`, `EVO`, and `TREND` blocks are the backbone of the world's instability. You must base ‚ÄúThe Loom of Fate‚Äù section directly on these codes. All plot hooks and future threats must be natural extensions of these blocks.
    
- **Inter-Block Causality:** Explicitly show how one value shapes another. _Example: "Because this world has a feudal authority structure (A:4) and a fragmented trade network (TN:3), regional powers often block one another‚Äôs markets, leading to localized monopolies."_
    
- **Narrative Integration of Trends:** When describing a faction or region, if a `TREND` or `EVO` block directly relates to it, weave that description directly into the summary. Do not save all trend information for the 'Loom of Fate' section.
